# LTSpice-like-Software
In this experiment, we attempt to write a program that can solve electrical circuits for us.
We will build this in 2 parts.I have created 2 parts, the first part which reads the ciruit from the netlist file 
and the second part which solves the circuit. The circuit has only simple devices.
